## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **automated retinal disease classification** using a **hybrid Quantum–Classical Machine Learning** approach.  
The system classifies **retinal fundus images** into four categories:  

- 👁 **Glaucoma**  
- 👁‍🗨 **Normal**  
- 👁‍🗨 **Diabetic Retinopathy**  
- 👁‍🗨 **Cataract**  

The project leverages **Quantum Computing (PennyLane framework)** integrated with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to enhance accuracy and explore the potential of **quantum-enhanced machine learning** in medical imaging.
